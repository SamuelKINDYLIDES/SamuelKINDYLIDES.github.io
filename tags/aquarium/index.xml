      <description>What makes a self-sustaining aquarium
The basic idea behind a self-sustaining aquarium is to create an aquarium which inhabitants don&#39;t need constant care to survive. You don&#39;t need to add anything to the aquarium, and you don&#39;t need to take anything out. The only outside help you need to provide is light and the addition of water from time to time. Creating perfect balance in such a restrained space is a pretty complicated feat to accomplish, requiring a lot of patience and potentially multiple attempts to succeed.</description>
